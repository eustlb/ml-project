# Datasets
## Boston Housing
Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altavish/boston-housing-dataset) 

This dataset is composed of 506 observations of 14 variables.
There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset:
- CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
- ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT - % lower status of the population
- **MEDV** - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

Here, we are trying to predict the variable **MEDV** from the 13 others.
